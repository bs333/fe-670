    "The S&P 500 stock market index, maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, comprises 500 large-cap American companies covering about 75 percent of the American equity market by capitalization. The index is weighted by market capitalization, so large companies account for relatively more of the index with the symbol SPY. The amount of change in the price of these stocks will be highly correlated, as they are all part of the larger market. Factor analysis will be used to reduce the dimensionality of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 stock market index to reflect the influence of 11 major industry sectors."

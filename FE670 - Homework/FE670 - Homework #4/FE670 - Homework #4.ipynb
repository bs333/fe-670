    "The Relative Strength Index is a momentum oscillator that is used by traders to identify whether the market is in the state of overbought or oversold. A market is considered to be in the state of overbought when an asset is constantly bought by traders moving it to an extremely bullish trend and bound to consolidate. Similarly, a market is considered to be in the state of oversold when an asset is constantly sold by traders moving it to a bearish trend and tends to bounce back."

    "As an oscillation market indicator, the values of RSI bound between 0 to 100. The traditional way to evaluate a market state using the Relative Strength Index is that an RSI reading of 70 or above reveals a state of overbought, and similarly, an RSI reading of 30 or below represents the market is in the state of oversold. The standard setting of RSI is 14 as the lookback period."

EMA is a type of Moving Average (MA) that automatically allocates greater weighting (nothing but importance) to the most recent data point and lesser weighting to data points in the distant past. In this step, we will first calculate the returns of the asset and separate the gains from losses. Using these separated values, the two EMAs for a specified number of periods are calculated.\n",

Calculating the Relative Strength of an asset: The Relative Strength of an asset is determined by dividing the Exponential Moving Average of the gain of an asset from the Exponential Moving Average of the loss of an asset for a specified number of periods. It can be mathematically represented in equation (2).\n",

To calculate the values of RSI of a given asset for a specified number of periods, there is a formula that we need to follow equation (1)."

Note: you are defining a function named *get_rsi* that takes the closing price of a stock *ticker* and the lookback period *lookback* as parameters. Inside the function, you are first calculating the returns of the stock using the *diff* function provided by the Pandas package and stored it into the *ret* variable. This function basically subtracts the current value from the previous value. Next, you are passing a for-loop on the *ret* variable to distinguish gains from losses and append those values to the concerning variable (*up* or *down*)."

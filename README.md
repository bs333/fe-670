## FE670 - Algorithmic Trading Strategies 

The following repository holds all the code, assignments, and notes for the course FE670 - Algorithmic Trading Strategies.

### Course Description

This course investigates methods implemented in multiple quantitative trading strategies with emphasis on automated trading and quantitative finance based approaches to enhance the trade-decision making mechanism.  

The course provides a comprehensive view of the algorithmic trading paradigm and some of the key quantitative finance foundations of these trading strategies. Topics explore markets, financial modeling and its pitfalls, factor model based strategies, portfolio trading strategies, liquidation strategies, arbitrage strategies, and machine learning enhanced strategies. 

The data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence-based trading strategies include, but not limited to, weak classifier method, decision tree, neural network, and genetic programming algorithmic, and other deep learning methods. 

The course will also introduce emerging technologies in trading decisions such as Explainable AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) investing through use case studies.

### Student Learning Outcomes

This is an advanced course in financial market and algorithmic trading. The learning objectives include mastering the fundamental techniques used in security trading that would include the fundamental factor based investing, portfolio based trading decision, arbitrage trading strategies, execution strategies, and machine learning/artificial intelligence enhanced trading strategies. 

The learning objectives also include that the students should understand the mathematical foundation and formulation of these trading strategies. Although the students are not required to derive these algorithms or models, they need to understand the rationale and key assumptions used in these techniques. 

Applications of the major advanced trading strategies are the focus of the course. To support the proficient understanding and application, the course requires students to implement all the major categories of advanced trading strategies using Python programming language, and the students are expected to master the understating of the standard libraries introduced in the course as well as the public domain financial data retrieving techniques using Python packages.

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to demonstrate proficient knowledge and application capabilities in the following areas:
- Understand the mathematical rationale and algorithms among the major trading strategies including fundamental factors, portfolio trading, execution, and arbitrage strategies.
- Able to apply advanced statistical, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques to the major trading strategies to enhance the trading outcomes.
- Understand the major machines learning and artificial intelligence techniques and apply them effectively in implementing the major trading strategies using Python programming language.
- Obtain fundamental knowledge in algorithmic trading and be able to read latest research papers to acquire recent development in the field and enhance the baseline trading algorithms.
- Understand the full lifecycle of developing a trading system where advanced trading strategies can be effectively incorporated and updated for better performance and operation efficiency.
- Learn emerging concepts around quantitative investment decision making using Explainable AI, LLMs, and ESG analytics, etc. Students will be equipped with Python programming skills to explore new techniques.
